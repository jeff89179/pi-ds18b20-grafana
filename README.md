# pi-ds18b20-grafana

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS

I lost the original link to where I found this python script. Once I find it again, i'll credit the original author.



- The purpose of this is to be able to graph multiple ds18b20 temperature probes connected to a Raspberry Pi.
- Currently, my setup involves two separately running python scripts that run at reboot via cron.
- Use the two t#-logger.py scripts as templates. Some things will have to be changed to fit your own setup (such as the w1 identifiers).
